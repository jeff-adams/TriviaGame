# Trivia Game

> A simple trivia game app using [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/)

This was a learning exercise, combining the topics below:
- async/await methods
- external API use
- the new JSON library with .Net Core 3.0
- the new `using` statement from C# 8.0

Note: The project needs further work with handling user input and exceptions.
